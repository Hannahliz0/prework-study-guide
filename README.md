# Study Guide Website
A study guide for course pre-work.

## Description

My motivation for this project was to teach me coding and building websites. 
This Study Guide was built to assit students with keeping up and organizing their notes throughout their course with the electronic note managment.  
This solved the fustration of having multiple note pages, seperate journals, and hurting hands due to writing. 
I learned how to build the structure of a website, how to style the website, and making the website functional.
